# My Personal Website

Made possible with HTML, CSS and JS, my personal website at **[dzuizz.com](https://dzuizz.com/)** contains my CV, some games, my family, and a brief overview of most of the competitive programming algorithms I know.

> Using the power of the ***Pelican Python Library***, and the simplicity of Jinja2 along with some **HTML, CS and JS***, I created my personal website.
