<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hello, my name is Ahmad Dzuizz Annajib. I love problem solving. I satisfy my thirst for problem solving by solving Math problems and puzzles and many more.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>My fascination of <strong>technology</strong> was sparked when I first got exposed to it at the age of 4 in 2014 with <strong><em>LEGO Education WeDo 2.0</em></strong>. Since then, I have been enthusiastically exploring the vast world of technology, mainly coding. I had always been intrigued at the rapid growth of technology and its community. Back then, building a website could only be someone's dream but now, even I can build <a href="https://dzuizz.com/">a website</a>. I believe that coding is my passion and my future career, which is why I would spend hours practising it. To realise my lifelong dream of being able to give back to society with my coding skills, I would need to plan my journey thoughtfully. This is the reason NJC is the right school for me. I know that with what NJC offers, I can evolve my coding dexterity beyond its boundaries.</p>

<h1>Game Plan</h1>
<h4>STEAM - Science, Technology, Engineering, Aesthetics, and Mathematics</h4>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In technology, I see a purposeful and appropriate vocation, yet what I love most is its combination of problem solving and creative thinking.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>My fascination of <strong>technology</strong> was sparked when I first got exposed to it at the age of 4 in 2014 with <strong><em>LEGO Education WeDo 2.0</em></strong>. Since then, I have been enthusiastically exploring the vast world of technology, mainly programming. I had always been intrigued at the rapid growth of technology and its community.</p>
<h3>Science</h3>
<p>After my first exposure to Science at the age of 8, I was hooked. I was always fascinated by the world of science and its vast and complex world as it helped me to better understand the world around me.</p>
<h3>Engineering</h3>
<p>Engineering is a very complex subject. It is a subject that is not only intellectually challenging, but also a subject that is very intellectually rewarding. I have always been drawn to engineering because of its potential to change the world.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>As I pondered deeper on my innate nature, I realized that I was a very aesthetic person as I took much effort to make my website look aesthetically pleasing. I was always interested in the world of design and its vast and complex use of psychology of human thinking. Last year, I read an article about design psychology and it inspired me to apply the psychologies on my website design.</p>
<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>At the age of 8, I was fascinated by the world of mathematics. I saw it not only as a subject, but as a way of life. I was always drawn to mathematics because it explained the world around me. I saw mathematics not as a way of passing examinations, but as a way of solving real world problems.</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>From even before my kindergarten days, I had been taught in one way or another about several topics. However, my thist for knowledge was not yet satisfied. My passion for learning caused me to want to learn more with every topic I conquered. Until now, my hunger is not satisfied. However, I am sure that it will be best satisfied with the help of the best school, with the best teachers, and the best classmates.</p></article>
